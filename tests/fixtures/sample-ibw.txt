1) Ronald Acuna Jr. - ATL, OF, 26.2. The 2023 NL MVP is as close to a sure thing as you'll find in fantasy baseball. He's coming off a historic 40-70 season and should be the first player selected in most drafts. He provides elite production across all five categories.

2) Mike Trout - LAA, OF, 32.5. Despite injury concerns, when healthy, Trout remains one of the best players in baseball. His combination of power and plate discipline makes him a perennial MVP candidate. The concern is his ability to stay on the field for a full season.

3) Juan Soto - NYY, OF, 25.8. After a disappointing 2022 season, Soto bounced back in a big way with the Padres before being traded to the Yankees. His elite plate discipline and power combination makes him a cornerstone player for any fantasy team.

4) Fernando Tatis Jr. - SD, SS, 25.1. Coming off suspension, Tatis Jr. is back and ready to reclaim his spot among the elite fantasy players. His combination of power and speed, along with shortstop eligibility, makes him incredibly valuable in fantasy formats.
